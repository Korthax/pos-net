# Pos.Net

## About

**pos.net** is a C# port of Darius Kazemi fork of [pos-js](https://github.com/dariusk/pos-js) created by Percy Wegmann ([pos-js](https://github.com/neopunisher/pos-js)) which is a javascript port of Mark Watson's FastTag Part of Speech Tagger which was itself based on Eric Brill's trained rule set and English
lexicon.

**pos.net** includes a basic lexer that can be used to extract words and other tokens from text strings.

**pos.net** was written by [Steve Phillips](https://github.com/Korthax) and is [available on Github](https://github.com/Korthax/pos-net).

## Usage

```csharp
var tagger = new PartsOfSpeechTagger(Lexicon.Default, new BrillTransformationRules());

var words = Lexer.Lex("This is some sample text. This text can contain multiple sentences.");
var tags = tagger.Tag(words);
var elapsedTime = stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds;

foreach(var tag in tags)
    Console.WriteLine("{0} / {1}", tag.Word, tag.Tag);

// extend the lexicon
var tagger = new PartsOfSpeechTagger(Lexicon.Default, new BrillTransformationRules());
tagger.ExtendLexicon(new Dictionary<string, string[]>
{
    ["Obama"] = new[] { "NNP" }
});
var tags = tagger.Tag(new List<string> { "Mr", "Obama" });
```
